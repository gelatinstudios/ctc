# ctc
Small Windows-only utility that copies from stdin to the clipboard. Helpful for piping the output of other tools.

I wrote this a long time ago because i didn't know that [clip](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/clip) existed. So yeah, just use `clip`. You don't need this.
